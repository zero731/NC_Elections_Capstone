    "The 2020 general election saw many key <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president\"> battleground states</a> battleground states with extremely close margins for not only the presidential race, but for races at virtually every level of the ballot. This resulted in recounts in several states and Senate runoff elections in Georgia. We also witnessed the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/elections/voter-turnout/\">highest voter turnout in over a century</a>, with 2/3 of every American elligible to vote casting a ballot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the battleground states flipped from red to blue during the 2020 election in the midst of this massive voter turnout. However, my home state of North Carolina was not one of them. The 2020 election saw above average <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1184621/presidential-election-voter-turnout-rate-state/\"> voter turnout in NC</a> as compared to the country as a whole, with 71.5% of elligible North Carolinians showing up at the polls. In the last 3 presidential elections, North Carolina has made the list of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/09/politics/2020-election-trump-biden-closest-states/index.html\"> top 10 states</a> with the closest margin. This was also reflected at the state level in 2020, with one <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/North_Carolina_Supreme_Court_elections,_2020\"> NC Supreme Court race</a> being decided by a margin of just 412 votes after a recount. When political races are as close as we saw in the 2020 general election, absolutely every vote counts. Thus, it is important to understand who is voting, and who is failing to turnout to the polls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on examining trends in voter turnout in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 elections in Union County, NC. I intend to scale up to examining statewide trends once finalized voter history records have been released for the 2020 general election for every county. I combined information from NC voter registration records with records of each registered individual's voting history, and built models to predict whether or not an individual participated (Vote vs. No Vote) and what voting method they used (Early, Election Day, or No Vote), with separate models for each year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Across all years, it was relatively difficult to predict a voter's participation in Union County based solely on the demographic information included in voter registration records. Binary (Vote vs. No Vote) model performance tended to max out at around 67% overall accuracy, with better performance correctly classifying people who did cast a ballot. Multiclass (Early, Election Day, No Vote) model performance tended to max out at around 50% overall accuracy. Interpretation of each model and a comparison of general elections by year for Union County can be found in <a href=\"https://github.com/zero731/NC_Elections_Capstone/blob/main/Final_Part_III_Model_Interpret_UC_Elecs.ipynb\"> Part III</a> Part III of this project. Additionally, as part of this project, I created an interactive dashboard to help visualize trends in voter participation and demographics in Union County, NC. I will post the link here when it has been launched."

    "In this notebook, I merged the two files (data used for the current version of this project obtained from the NCSBE site on January 4, 2021) to obtain a single dataframe containing both demographic and vote history information for each registered voter in Union County. To see an explanation of my next major steps in cleaning and preparing the data for visualizing and modeling, see the beginning of the [Scrub and Explore](#scrub_explore) section of this notebook. Some of the steps taken were necessary, but somewhat limit the scope of how the models can be applied and how trends should be interpreted."

    "The major steps I took in cleaning and preparing the data for modelling and visualizing were as follows:\n",
    "1. **Drop duplicate records from both voter history records.** This included identical duplicates and records/ rows that were not completely identical, but shared the same combination of `ncid` (unique voter ID) and `election_desc` (the specific election for which the voter cast a ballot). Each `ncid` should only show up in a given election once, since each voter gets a single vote. To see the code and explanation for how this problem was handled, jump to [this section](#drop_dup).\n",
    "2. **Drop voter registration records for individuals with \"Removed\" or \"Denied\" status.** These individuals are currently (as of January 4) inelligible to vote within Union County. Because the records do not indicate when their status was changed, I could not account for the fact that they may have been elligible to vote in either the 2012 or 2016 election. Thus the dataframes for those elections may be missing individuals who were elligible to vote then, but not in 2020.\n",
    "3. **Merge cleaned voter history data onto cleaned voter registration data on `ncid`.**\n",
    "4. **Create a separate dataframe for each election (general 2012, 2016, and 2020).** Individuals were excluded from an election dataframe for a given year if they were not registered in time to vote in that election, or if they were too young to vote that year. This left one record per elligible, registered individual in each dataset, even if they did not cast a vote in that particular year."
